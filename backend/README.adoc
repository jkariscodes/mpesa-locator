= Mpesa Location Back-End

The back-end consists of a Docker container with _Python 3.10_ and _Django 4.2.2_.

All Python package requirements are listed in
link:Pipfile[`Pipfile`] and their dependencies and associated hashes  in link:Pipfile.lock[`Pipfile.lock`] which supports more secure verification and enables deterministic builds. Refer to link:https://pipenv.pypa.io/[Pipenv docs] for more details. The initial requirements include:

* https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/[Django] as the base framework
* http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/siteindex.html[markdown] for rendering
 markdown in HTML
* https://www.django-rest-framework.org/[djangorestframework] for creating the
 API for the front-end to consume
* https://github.com/openwisp/django-rest-framework-gis/[djangorestframework-gis] for adding geographic add-ons for Django Rest Framework
* https://docs.pytest.org[pytest] for writing tests
* https://github.com/psf/black[black] for linting and automatically formatting
 the code
* https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/[django-debug-toolbar] to
 help with debugging
* https://psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/[psycopg] Modern implementation of a PostgreSQL adapter for Python using Psycopg3
* https://psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/[psycopg-binary] to
 help with development using psycopg3 using pre-compiled libraries
* https://django-leaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[django-leaflet] to
 enable using leaflet assets and object in Django project
* https://django-leaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[django-environ] to
 enable configuration of Django application with environment variables
* https://django-leaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[dj-database-url] to
 provide support for database URL environment variable
* https://django-leaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[django-filter] to
 allow filtering of querysets dynamically
* https://django-leaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[djangorestframework-simplejwt] to allow implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication

If you'd like to install additional dependencies, use `pipenv shell` to create a virtual environment, then run `pipenv install <your package>` which automatically adds them to the
link:Pipfile[`Pipfile`] file and rebuild the Docker containers
with `make build-dev` for development and `make build` in production.

The application uses the _PostGIS_ database back-end by default.

== Apps

There are two Django `apps` in this application:

* link:users[`users`] app - Facilitates authentication concerns like logging the user in through the login form.
* link:mpesa_loc/[`mpesa_loc`] app - The core business logic of the application â€“
 is serving as a GIS backend. Exposes a REST API that can be consumed by the front-end. Everything related to the API is in the
 link:../backend/[`backend`] folder. This includes very standard Django
 REST Framework viewsets in link:mpesa_api/viewsets.py[`mpesa_api/viewsets.py`],
 serializers in link:mpesa_api/serializers.py[`mpesa_api/serializers.py`], and
 link:users/serializers.py[`users/serializers.py`], registering the routes from those viewsets in
 link:mpesa_api/routers.py[`mpesa_api/routers.py`] and link:users/routers.py[`users/routers.py`].

There are also some tests in the link:mpesa_api/tests.py[`mpesa_api/test.py`] and
link:users/tests.py[`users/test.py`] files.

== Linting

https://github.com/psf/black[Black] is used to automatically format and lint
files. The `make lint-django` command checks that the project is correctly
formatted.

You can set up your editor to automatically format Python files using Black
following the instructions https://github.com/psf/black#editor-integration[on Black's GitHub
page].

You can also use the `make lint-django-fix` command to automatically format all
Python files in the project.

== Front-end

The front-end is a React app that's rendered through Django.

Read more about how the front-end works in the link:../frontend/README.adoc[frontend
`README.adoc`].
